# Public Upstream Integration Notes


cchahatui is developed from the public cc-haha and DeepSeek-TUI projects. To integrate the desktop workspace, Agents/Skills/MCP, Computer Use, remote access, and DeepSeek-first model experience into an independent product, this repository keeps and adapts the following compatibility fixes:

| Issue | Root cause | Fix |
|------|------|------|
| TUI does not start | The entry script routed no-argument startup to the recovery CLI | Restored the full `cli.tsx` entry |
| Startup hangs | The `verify` skill imports a missing `.md` file, causing Bun's text loader to hang indefinitely | Added stub `.md` files |
| `--print` hangs | `filePersistence/types.ts` was missing | Added type stub files |
| `--print` hangs | `ultraplan/prompt.txt` was missing | Added resource stub files |
| **Enter key does nothing** | The `modifiers-napi` native package was missing, `isModifierPressed()` threw, `handleEnter` was interrupted, and `onSubmit` never ran | Added try/catch fault tolerance |
| Setup was skipped | `preload.ts` automatically set `LOCAL_RECOVERY=1`, skipping all initialization | Removed the default setting |
